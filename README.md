# ENERGYMONITOR_WIFI
This tutorial demonstrates how to connect an arduino + esp8266 board, a energy monitor shield and two current transformers to Adafruit IO.

## Hardware
The microcontroller board is a combination of an arduino UNO and a ESP8266. Although this board is quite the Frankenstein's monster, it works well for this project.
